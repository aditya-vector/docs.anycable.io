# Upgrading from 0.6.x to 1.0.0

## Rails

### Remove session access hacks

Rails `session` object in Action Cable connection is supported out-of-the-box. No additional hacking is needed.

### Use AnyCable Rack middleware to support `env["warden"]`

For example, for Devise all you need is to add the following configuration:

```ruby
AnyCable::Rails::Rack.middleware.use Warden::Manager do |config|
  Devise.warden_config = config
end
```

See also [Authentication](../ruby/authentication.md).

## `anycable-go`

### Default host changed

The default value for HTTP server host has changed from `0.0.0.0` to `localhost`.

If you want to continue using `0.0.0.0`, configure your server explicitly:

```sh
$ anycable-go --host=0.0.0.0

# or via env vars
$ ANYCABLE_HOST=0.0.0.0 anycable-go
```
