# Authentication

## Rack middlewares

Most authentication strategies rely on request cookies or session (directly or indirectly).

Cookies and Rails session object are supported in AnyCable out-of-the-box. If you rely on some
other Rack request properties (e.g., `request.env["something"]`) for your authentication, you must configure
AnyCable Rack middleware stack to make them work (because requests in AnyCable are not passed through the default Rails stack).

You can do this through the `AnyCable::Rails::Rack.middleware` object in your configuration. See Devise/Warden example below.

## Devise/Warden

Devise relies on [`warden`](https://github.com/wardencommunity/warden) Rack middleware to authenticate users.

In order to make it work with AnyCable, you must add this middleware to AnyCable's middleware stack like this:

```ruby
AnyCable::Rails::Rack.middleware.use Warden::Manager do |config|
  Devise.warden_config = config
end
```

You can put this code, for example, into an initializer (`config/initializers/anycable.rb`) or any other configuration file.
